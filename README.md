## ‚≠ê Overview

&nbsp;

### **The challenge:**

The App is a part of recruitment process to Junior Front-End Developer of [Spektrum IT](www.spektrumit.pl)

### **Solutions provided in the project:**

- HTML:
  - The project was built using semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS:
  - The css styles are created using `styled-components`.
  - It was prepared fully responsive app.
  - The `Custom Checkbox` was created.
- TS:
  - ES2015+ (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator) was used.
  - To store all communication with the API in one place, the function DataAPI was created (in the separated file `DataAPI.js`).
  - Communication with API is based on `axios()`.
  - All fields are validated using `yup` and `RegExr`.
- React:
  - The following hooks were used: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback` and `useContext`.
  - To make easier managing register forms `react-hook-forms` and `useForm()` hook was used.
  - In case of extending the app to simplify this process, the components are split and kept as simple as possible that will.

I had opted to use `styled-components` as a solution for managing the CSS.

To make coding with `styled-component` more comfortable, I used a special Extension in Visual Studio Code `vscode-styled-components`.

I used the `createGlobalStyle` function from styled-components and added reset style and some global styles (`Reset.js` and `Global.js`)

```
import {createGlobalStyle} from 'styled-components';

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
    @font-face {
        font-family: "Lato";
        font-style: normal;
        font-weight: 400;
        src:
        url(${LatoRegularWoff2}) format('woff2'),
        url(${LatoRegularWoff}) format('woff');
    }
    // ...
```

Hook `useContext` was used to provide access to data by both `RegisterForm` and `StarWars components` the form with user inputs. The folowing context was created:

```
interface ProfileData {
  name: string;
  created: string;
  vehicles: string[] | [];
}

type ProfileContextType = {
  avatarProfileList: ProfileData[] | [];
  setAvatarProfileList: React.Dispatch<
    React.SetStateAction<ProfileData[] | []>
  >;
};

const iProfileContextState = {
  avatarProfileList: [],
  setAvatarProfileList: () => {},
};

const ProfileListContext =
  React.createContext<ProfileContextType>(iProfileContextState);

export { ProfileListContext };

```
Hook `useForm` was used to manage register forms.

```
import { FieldValues, useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
  ..... 
  const {
      register,
      handleSubmit,
      reset,
      formState: { errors },
    } = useForm<FieldValues>({
      resolver: yupResolver(valdationSchema),
      mode: 'all',
    });

```
